# library_of_life
`library_of_life` is a Python package that provides a client interface for interacting with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) API. The library is organized into submodules representing different APIs within the GBIF service, making it easy to access various resources related to biodiversity data.

## Installation

You can install `library_of_life` via pip:

```bash
pip install library_of_life
```

## Quick Start

Here's a quick example to get you started with `library_of_life`:

```python
from library_of_life.registry.datasets import Datasets
from library_of_life.species.name_usage import NameUsage

# Initialize the Datasets and NameUsage classes
dataset_client = Datasets()
name_usage_client = NameUsage()

# List current datasets matching specified parameters
dataset = dataset_client.list_datasets(dataset_type="SAMPLING_EVENT", limit=10)
print(dataset)

# Return all vernacular species names by a specific usage key
vernacular_names= name_usage_client.get_usage_vernacular_names_by_usage_key(5231190)
print(vernacular_names)
```

## Modules

Each module is composed of separate submodules reflecting the divisions in the GBIF APIs. Within each of these submodules is a class and appropriate methods for accessing the data and resources available for the respective endpoints.

### Registry

For now the registry module only contains the principal methods, but it will be updated in the future to include all of the methods.

#### Submodules

- `datasets`
- `publishing_orgs`
- `participant_nodes`
- `networks`
- `tech_installations`
- `collections`
- `institutions`
- `institutions_and_collections`
- `derived_datasets`

### Species

#### Submodules

- `name_usage`
- `name_search`
- `name_parser`

### Occurrence

#### Submodules

- `single_occurrence`
- `search`
- `downloads`
- `download_format`
- `download_stats`
- `metrics`
- `inventories`
- `gadm_regions`
- `country_usages`
- `organization_usages`

### Maps (in development)

### Literature (pre-dev)

### Validator (pre-dev)

### Vocabulary (pre-dev)

## Caching

Each class contains an optional caching feature using requests_cache. Simply set use_caching to True when initializing the respective class.

## Authentication

As some features of the GBIF API require authentication (POST, PUT, DETETE methods), this package handles both basic authentication (username and password) and OAuth2 authentication. This is dealt with at the class level. The default is for basic authentication, but if OAuth is desired, simply pass auth_type="OAuth" when initializing the class, as wellas the necessary credentials. Future versions may handle this with a config file.
